## Random notes related to the addition of the V80 turbine

Also keep in mind that I added the first 2 values in the thrust table. They are just something I decided lol. (1.00 and 0.900)
Also wtf is TSR... The TSR is the tip speed ratio. This is the value at which the Cp and Ct values are taken at.
