# Notes

## The outcome
He said that I should probably write a biuit about sowfa in the introduction. I dont need a litterature review chapter, but it should be included in the introduction.

I need some future work and master thesis plan in the paper.


This is what to do before next time:
- Read this paper: Wind farm flow control: prospects and challenges
- Send a draft before next meeting of my paper.
- 




## Since last time
Show plots from overleaf
Note that gch seems to overestimate (?) the greedy poweroutput.


## Questions
- Is litterature review a must in the prethesis?
	- If yes, what is the form
- Plans for the remaining prethesis
	- I feel that I have a good understanding of Floris, should I do some "quick" RL problems also?

## Notes written under meeting
