# Notes

## The outcome
To be written after the meeting.

For next meeting, do the following:
1) [x] Make sure that axial induction is 100% implemented
2) [x] Use the 5x5 distance wind farm and make a plot about how much power gain there is to extract with axial induction.
3) [x] With a fixed axial induction, then do 3 simulations, with 3, 8 and 15 % turbulence intensity. Then see how much power gain there is to get with yaw optimization.
4) [x] Do the same with spacing, but now with 4, 7 and 10D spacing, and 7.7% Ti. Again use the yaw optimization.
5) [ ] Look at scaling, the axial induction is giving weird results.


## Since last time:
- Tried with the axial induction
	- 2 different methods.
		- 1) "normal" axial induction
			- $$ a = \dfrac{0.5}{cos(yaw)} \cdot (1-\sqrt{1-Ct \cdot cos(yaw) } $$
			- Gives:
			- $$ Ct = a \cdot (4-cos(yaw)\cdot a) $$ 
			- Power then calculated from:
				- $$P = 0.5 \cdot 
 \rho \cdot A \cdot V^3 \cdot Cp \cdot cos(yaw)^{Pp}
 $$
		- 2) Scaling factor
			- Ct found from table and effective velocity
			- Ct multiplied with scaling factor
			- a calculated.
				- Power is found from table, but scaled aswell.
- Read paper
	- They found the parameters for the gauss model.
	- Then optimized the yaw with uncertainty included.
- Did the yaw optimizing.
	- Show figures.
