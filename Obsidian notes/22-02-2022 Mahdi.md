# Notes

## The outcome, written after meeting
For next meeting, I should make a farm of one row, with 6 turbines, with 6D spacing.
It should be V80 vestas turbine.
Inlet speed if 10 m/s.
Turbulence intensity of 7.7%
If C_t and C_p is not defined, then I can use C_t = 0.8, and then find the a value and then the C_p values.

define the superpostion method and the wake model
Make plot of turbine outputs.


The learning is:
- How to change parameters
- How to deifne stuff
- Change windmill
- 


### Random stuff written down
One case to model with Floris
Wind speed, and with turbulence intensity.
Velocity at the different turbines. 

6 turbines in a row. 
7D between
Also 3 rows with 5D between

Get poweroutput from turbines.
windspeed and TI

Windshear should not have any effect on the deficit.


One wind direction
One row, 6 turb, 7D spacing.
Z_hub height

How to define this:
V80 vestas.
V_inlet=10
Ti=7.7%
Maybe define Ct and Cp.
C_t = 0.8 approx
C_p 0....

from Ct, find a -> find Cp

What super posisiton is used.
Wake model used? 

Normalized power output
