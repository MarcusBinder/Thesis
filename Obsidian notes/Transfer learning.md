nHere are some "random" links related to transfer learning.

https://github.com/jindongwang/transferlearning   Overview?



https://github.com/Jonathan-Pearce/transfer_learning_rl
- Is a school project. Has report and more documented
- Read this!


https://github.com/trunghieu-tran/Transfer-Learning-in-Reinforcement-Learning
- Another school project
- Looks very in depth!
- THIS MIGHT BE IT!
- Read this!


https://www.learnpytorch.io/06_pytorch_transfer_learning/
- From the learn PyTorch course.

https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=reinforcement+transfer+learning
- Just the papers with code search.

https://www.reddit.com/r/reinforcementlearning/comments/ffxbrf/d_transfer_learning_for_rl/
- Links some papers that might be somewhat relevant 

https://www.reddit.com/r/reinforcementlearning/comments/wx9akm/question_regarding_transfer_learning_with/
- My post

Stuff that I don't think will be useful

https://github.com/elisim/Transfer-Learning-In-RL   
- not really documented. Might look usefull, but no real comments.

https://github.com/anksng/Transfer-learning-in-Deep-Reinforcement-learning
- School project. looks like low quality. Also only for the same environment just changes weight of pole.

https://github.com/ianxxiao/reinforcement_learning_project
https://github.com/ianxxiao/transfer_learning_RL
- The last is a failed continuation of the first. I don't think this is relevant. 

https://github.com/yaserkl/TransferRL
- They use RL to do the transfer of a "normal" neural network to some text summation on something. 

https://github.com/ankurs287/Transfer-Learning-for-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning
- Uses transfer learning, but the action space is the same

https://github.com/abhishekmaha23/rapid-policy-transfer-rl
- Might be useful, but I already think I have enough, so not worth to dig deeper into it atm.

https://github.com/PeteXC/Transfer-Learning
- They use a GAN, to make the "new" environment like the old. The action space is the same.

https://github.com/tianpeiyang/MAPTF_code
- This is for multi agent

https://colab.research.google.com/github/Stable-Baselines-Team/rl-colab-notebooks/blob/sb3/pretraining.ipynb#scrollTo=nvjjl19iMMs7
- Pretraining, not transfer learning.
