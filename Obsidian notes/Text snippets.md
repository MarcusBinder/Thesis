''An agent is an autonomous entity that can observe the environment and choose how to act based on those observations''
Multi agents means several agents.

They can be Cooperative (helping each other) or adversarial (competing with each other) or mixed.

## Introduction to problem
### Wind energy is the future
Something about wind energy being the future, and more wind will be used. https://youtu.be/wLoMfLBYcQg?t=5318

### Problems in wind farms
Wakes are a problem... Can be fixed with axial induction or yaw control (or tilt).
A lot of parameters so hard to model.

Turbines down for maintenance. 

## Theory behind wind/wake calculations
A chapter dedicated to the maths behind wind/wake calculations.

- Short introduction about power production of a turbine.
	- Cp, Ct and yaw angles
- Wake formulas
	- Different formulas, and the categories of them
		- Wake velocity
		- Wake turbulence
		- Wake deflection
		- Wake combination
	- Gaussian wake from floris, derivation.
	- Discussion about l


## Reinforcement learning
A chapter dedicated to go over the math behind a chosen algorithm.
The sections could be:
### Introduction to RL
Markov decision.
### Model based vs model free
Maybe not relevant anymore. Depend on chosen algorithm.
### Theory behind chosen algorithm
Maths


## Wind farm environment
Description of the environment and the formulas/models used.
Also some text about the software packages used.

## Experiments
Big ol list of experiments.

## Results
Big ol list of result of experiments
