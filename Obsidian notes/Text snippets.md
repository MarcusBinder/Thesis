This is for small sections of text, that can maybe be incorporated in the thesis.


''An agent is an autonomous entity that can observe the environment and choose how to act based on those observations''
Multi agents means several agents.

They can be Cooperative (helping each other) or adversarial (competing with each other) or mixed.

### Problems in wind farms
Short introduction about potential problems with wakes in wind farms.

## Theory behind wind/wake calculations
A chapter dedicated to the math behind wind/wake calculations.

- Short introduction about power production of a turbine.
	- Cp, Ct and yaw angles
- Wake formulas
	- Different formulas, and the categories of them
		- Wake velocity

		- Wake combination
	- Gaussian wake from floris, possible derivation/detailed description of gaussian model used in floris.
	- Discussion about l


## Reinforcement learning
A chapter dedicated to go over the math behind a chosen algorithm.
The sections could be:
### Introduction to RL
Markov decision and general math behind rl
### Theory behind chosen algorithm
The math/specif formulas that the chosen algorithm depends on


## Wind farm environment
Description of the environment and the formulas/models used.
Also some text about the software packages used.
Action space, observation space.


## Experiments
Big ol list of experiments.

## Results
Big ol list of result of experiments
