''An agent is an autonomous entity that can observe the environment and choose how to act based on those observations''
Multi agents means several agents.

They can be Cooperative (helping each other) or adversarial (competing with each other) or mixed.

### Problems in wind farms
Wakes are a problem... Can be fixed with axial induction or yaw control (or tilt).
A lot of parameters so hard to model.

Turbines down for maintenance. 

## Wind farm environment
Description of the environment and the formulas/models used.


## Reinforcement learning

### Introduction to RL
Markov decision.

### Model based vs model free
text here.

### Theory behind chosen algorithm
Maths
