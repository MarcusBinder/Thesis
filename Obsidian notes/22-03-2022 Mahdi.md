# Notes


# The outcome
To be written after the meeting.

The following is to be done to next time:
- [x] Update my Floris version
- [x] Use http://getdata-graph-digitizer.com/ to get data from some of the plots!
- [x] Compare my "model" with some of the plots. Remember to add uncertainty and do it maybe as a shaded plot
- [x] Make plot of swept wind directions like in 2013 paper from Fernando - Figure 4
- [x] Read up on SOSFS, and find out what model floris uses for wake combinations.
- [ ] Look at the following papers:
	- [ ] Wind-Turbine and Wind-Farm Flows: A Review
	- [ ] Analytical solution for the cumulative wake of  wind turbines in wind farms
	- [ ] A Numerical Study of the Effects of Wind Direction on Turbine  Wakes and Power Losses in a Large Wind Farm. this is the 2013 paper


Maybe do a plot like this:

## My questions
- none atm

## Notes written under meeting 

http://getdata-graph-digitizer.com/
to extract data from plot

Add "uncertanty" to wind dircetion and average
or do uncertanty bars/shaded area

Also sweep wind directions like 2013 paper


read up on sosfa model

compare models
