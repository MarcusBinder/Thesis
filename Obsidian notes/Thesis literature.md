# Overview of papers
In the papers folder, there are some files. Here is a short overview of their content:


Also check the excel sheet!

[[Intelligent wind farm control via deep reinforcement learning and high fidelity simulations]]
In this paper they use reinforcement learning one a 3x2 grid (actually just a 3x1) of windmills, to control their yaw settings. They also look into the use of Floris, fast.farm, and SOWFA to train the model.
Has some good information, and looks kinda like what I want to achieve. 

[[Reinforcement learning on windturbines]]
I just skimmed through this, so be carefull, I might have missed some details!
This paper tries to control one turbine (i think it was only one). They want to optimize the power output, but also minimize stresses. 
They interface with QBLADE. This program looks intresting, but atm. I havent looked into it yet.

[[Gym Wind Turbine]]
This is in the \Code\RL\Gym wind turbine folder.
This is just a guy that made an [[OpenAI]] Gym with [[CCBlade]]. Seems cool! Might be worth looking into.
