## Someday

- [ ] Reinforcement learning tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbWhJdQgi7E
- [ ] Look into dynamic floris https://github.com/MarcusBecker-GitHub/FLORIDyn_Matlab<br>#Someday
- [ ] Do this course https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mut_u40Sqz4&t=1011s<br>#maybe
- [ ] Maybe read this blog post <br>https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-04-08-policy-gradient/


## To do

- [ ] UC berkley kursus om RL<br>http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/
- [ ] Create new timers <br>#admin
- [ ] Create overleaf document<br>#admin
- [ ] Update Floris


## Doing

- [ ] Do RLVS 2021 course<br>Videos done 4/24 <br>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJct-r1rjHKmqdcLMXHsX8Hp-cvUWMild


## Done

- [ ] SB3 tutorial https://github.com/araffin/rl-tutorial-jnrr19/tree/sb3
- [ ] Make a gif of the horns rev power plots https://stackoverflow.com/questions/753190/programmatically-generate-video-or-animated-gif-in-python
- [ ] Find out why the yaw optimization isnt symmetric... I think it is from the secondary effects
- [ ] Project contract<br>Din specialekontrakt skal afleveres senest den 14. juni 2022. Du skal p√•begynde dit speciale senest den 29. august 2022.
- [ ] Check more of floris. Why does gauss give so much more power then jensen..<br><br>Higher a gives bigger wake??
- [ ] https://careers.vestas.com/search/?q=loads%20and%20control&q2=&alertId=&locationsearch=&title=&location=aarhus%20N&department=&shifttype=&date=&fbclid=IwAR3hDZbUFlOVbjYTBB-Yf9kZ2jc31RDX-iWFWpHbdCjQRoNIzwDEFy2CuOI
- [ ] Add timeplan for project in overleaf
- [ ] Look at ulriks final problem statement, and brainstom my own
- [ ] Write the stuff for HornsRev in overleaf
- [ ] Find out what that new model in 3.0 was, and how to use it.<br>Do this by writing on hithub
- [ ] Read: analytical-solution-for-the-cumulative-wake-of-wind-turbines-in-wind-farms, this "a new cumulative model for wake superposistion"
- [ ] Translate the dynamic floris to python.. <br>Maybe use this? <br>https://github.com/ebranlard/matlab2python
- [ ] Read:  Addressing deep array effects and impacts to wake steering with the cumulative-curl wake model, this is "The new cumulative curl model"
- [ ] Try and get this paper https://www.osti.gov/pages/biblio/1781613<br>This content will become publicly available on April 20, 2022
- [ ] Check the axial induction optimzation and try out different solvers to see if they give different results
- [ ] Look into what the full_flow_sequential_solver does!<br>I think it is used for plotting!
- [ ] Ask Dario wtf is going on here, and how to do the example?<br>https://github.com/NREL/floris/pull/322
- [ ] Python OOP course. Video 17-25<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZeGkjE38bI&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfju7ADVp5W1GF9jVhjbX-_&index=17<br>Est: 2 hours
- [ ] No axial induction control?<br>https://github.com/NREL/floris/issues/314
- [ ] Support for multiple turbine types, maybe look into it: <br>https://github.com/NREL/floris/pull/325
- [ ] Power_scaler is weird, when saving to yaml...<br><br>This idea is scrapped
- [ ] Spend 4 hours doing overleaf
- [ ] Implement axial Induction in Floris https://github.com/search?p=2&q=axial+induction+floris&type=Code <br>Est 2 Days<br>This is probably a work in progress, but atm it's done.<br>Look at [[Adding axial induction to floris]]
- [ ] Look into the new super posisiton model for Floris <br>Est 1 hr<br>Im pretty sure that it is only avaliable in the cc model
