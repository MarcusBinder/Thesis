## Watched videos


- Deep Reinforcement Learning in Python Tutorial - A Course on How to Implement Deep Learning Papers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJJc1t0rtSU
	- Okay video, but a little overall

- RLVS 2021 - Day 6 - RL in practice: tips & tricks and practical session with stable-baselines3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikngt0_DXJg
	- Lists some nice resources, but is also just kinda an intro to RL

- God video om PPO! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEt6rrxH8W4
	- He just codes the PPO algorithm. I havent watched it, but imma trust it.
