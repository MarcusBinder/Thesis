# Thesis

### Nomenclature
- MARL --  Multi agent reinforcement learning   

## Possible directions and problems to look into for the thesis

- Define the goal objective/goal function
	- Should it be just power output, or should load mitigation/damage be included 

- The first step would be to use MARL on a 3x3 farm on a single wind direction.
	- Look into MARL algorithms (IAC, MADDPG... )
	- Find and code implementation

Then, what comes next?
- Use GNN to simulate if a turbine is down for maintenance?
- Use transfer learning to optimize a slightly different farm layout? (square to rhomboid) 
- Use transfer learning to scale up the farm (3x3 -> 9x9)
