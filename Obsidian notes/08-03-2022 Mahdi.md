# Notes


# The outcome
To be written after the meeting.

The following is to be done to next time:
1) Implement the V80 with constant Ct of 0.8. From this calculate *a* and then Cp.
2) Mahdi will send 2 papers (if not then mail him) to compare the results. 
3) Get an overview of:
	1) Wake combinations
	2) Wake deflections
	3) Wake turbulence
	4) Wake velocity 
4) Talk to Mahdi tomorrow to find out the scope of the preproject.
5) 




### My questions
- Scope of preproject
	- Where are we when the preproject is finished
	- ->
- End goal of thesis
	- Clear goal of what should be achieved
	- ->

## Notes written under meeting 



- cT 0.8
- cP 0.5.. CALCULATED from a

Check how wind shear is implemented in floris.
Overview about different wake models, super posistion, wake deficit, osv osv. 

Do validation and check different options
