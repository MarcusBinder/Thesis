# Notes


# The outcome
To be written after the meeting.

- Implement axial induction in floris  https://github.com/search?p=2&q=axial+induction+floris&type=Code 
- make a 3x3 turbine layout with 5D distance
- Find optimal a for all wind directions
	- Maybe use symmetry
- Find optimal yaw.
- Make nicer plots.
- [x] Read this: Sensitivity and **Uncertainty of the FLORIS Model Applied on the Lillgrund Wind Farm**

Here are mine todos:
- [x] https://github.com/MarcusBecker-GitHub/FLORIDyn_Matlab Look into this!! moved to kanban
- [x] https://github.com/JuliusAurelius/FLORIDyn
- [x] Maybe look into this. Try and get the paper https://www.osti.gov/pages/biblio/1781613 


## Notes written under meeting 

Now yaw the turbines. One row.
Plot how the power changes

Look what the new super posisiton model is.

make nicer plots.


Try to calculate the optimal yaws for 3x3 turbine layout.
5D in all directions. 

Normal optimization.
1) a
2) gamma
3) both?

just use whatever wake model
increment of 2 deg.
