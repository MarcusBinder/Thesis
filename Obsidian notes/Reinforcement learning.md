# Reinforcement learning
Here is a "guide" https://towardsdatascience.com/newbies-guide-to-study-reinforcement-learning-8b9002eff643

I should probably either follow this course: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning?ranMID=40328&ranEAID=vedj0cWlu2Y&ranSiteID=vedj0cWlu2Y-UaSqTD71GBhwQbgAN7oKxg&siteID=vedj0cWlu2Y-UaSqTD71GBhwQbgAN7oKxg&utm_content=10&utm_medium=partners&utm_source=linkshare&utm_campaign=vedj0cWlu2Y

Or this: https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-rl   I think this is the "smallest" course
