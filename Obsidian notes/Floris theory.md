# Floris theory

This is a collection of theory from floris.
The goal is to understand how the implemented models work, and how they are implemented.

Under the floris -> simulation folder, there are the following options:
- **Combination models**
	- [[FLS]]
	- [[MAX]]
	- [[SOSFS]]
- **Deflection model**
	- Curl
	- Jimenez
	- Gauss
- **Turbulence model**
	- Crespo hernandez
- **Velocity model**
	- Cumulative Gauss curl
	- Gauss
	- [[Jensen]] 


There is also:
- Jensen
- Multi Zone Wake model
- Gaussian Wake Models
- Gauss Curl Hybrid model
- Jimenez Wake Model
- Curled Wake Model
- TurbOPark Wake Model
