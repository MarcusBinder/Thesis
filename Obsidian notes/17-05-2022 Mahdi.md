# Notes
Not done from last time: - Read this paper: Wind farm flow control: prospects and challenges

## The outcome
To be written after meeting:


- [x] write søren and ask for cluster access
-  The powerpoint should just be a summary of the report. 
	- Introduction
	-  What I did
	-  What I want to do
-  The problem definition should be precise but flexible... ????
	- I can chose what to look into as I do the project.



## Questions

I need to decide what direction I'm taking the project in:

- Environment
	- Steady state or time dependent?
		- If time dependent, how do I chose realistic time series to train on?
- Reward function
	- The following are possibilities, or we can mix some of them
		- Total farm power output
		- Stable power output
		- Loads
			- We can either try to equally distribute the loads over the farm
			- Or we can minimize each turbines loads
		- Yaw
			- Minimize yaw travel?
- Agents
	- The agent is one Farm
	- The agent is the turbines
- Training
	- Train on one farm and that's it
	- Train on one farm and try to transfer and retrain on similar farm


Also what to include in the PPT?


## Notes written under meeting
Contract should be precise and flexible.

Start "small"
Yaw first under steady state.
